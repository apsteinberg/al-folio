Hello! If you've stumbled upon this page, it probably means you are interested in my research. This is a constant work in progress, but hopefully you'll walk away with some sense of what I've been up to scientifically.

I am a computational biologist in the Computational Oncology Program at MSK. Currently, I am working on collaborative research efforts between Alex Kentsis' team at the [Tow Center for Developmental Oncology](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/developmental-oncology/about-tow-center-developmental-oncology) and Sohrab Shah and Andrew McPherson's team in [Computational Oncology](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/computational-oncology).  With the team, I am developing computational methods to define the genomics, proteomics, and evolution of cancers in children and young adults. I did my postdoctoral training in the Department of Biology at NYU with [Edo Kussell](https://www.kussellgroup.org/) where I was a Simons Fellow of the [LSRF](http://www.lsrf.org/). Before this, I did my PhD in Chemistry at Caltech under the mentorship of [Rustem Ismagilov](https://ismagilovlab.caltech.edu/). During my training, my research focused on applying biophysical approaches, both computationally and experimentally, to problems ranging from the [soft matter physics of the gut](https://apsteinberg.github.io/projects/1_gutbiophysics/) to [microbial recombination](https://apsteinberg.github.io/projects/2_recombo/).
