Hello! If you've stumbled upon this page, it probably means you are interested in my research. This is a constant work in progress, but hopefully you'll walk away with some sense of what I've been up to scientifically.

I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Professor Edo Kussell](https://www.kussellgroup.org/) in the Biology Department at New York University. Currently, I am very fortunate to be a [Simons Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-life-sciences/) of the [Life Sciences Research Foundation](http://www.lsrf.org/). Prior to working with Edo, I spent 5+ mind-bending years doing my PhD at Caltech under the mentorship of [Rustem Ismagilov](https://ismagilovlab.caltech.edu/). My research has focused on applying biophysical approaches, both computationally and experimentally, to problems ranging from the [soft matter physics of the gut](https://apsteinberg.github.io/projects/1_gutbiophysics/) to [microbial recombination](https://apsteinberg.github.io/projects/2_recombo/).
